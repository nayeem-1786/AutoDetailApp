# Auto Detail App — Session Context

## Project
Smart Details Auto Spa — custom POS, booking, portal, and admin system replacing Square.
Full project spec: `docs/PROJECT.md` | Companion docs: `docs/CONVENTIONS.md`, `docs/COUPONS.md`, `docs/DASHBOARD_RULES.md`, `docs/DATA_MIGRATION_RULES.md`, `docs/SERVICE_CATALOG.md`

## Current Status
- **Phases 1–4:** Complete (Foundation, POS, Booking/Quotes/11Labs, Customer Portal)
- **Phase 5 (Marketing, Coupons & Campaigns):** In progress — partially built
- **POS Auth Decoupling:** Complete — POS uses independent HMAC token auth, fully separated from admin Supabase sessions

## Phase 5 — What's Done
- Coupon engine: CRUD, code validation at POS, types (flat/$/%/free item/free product), expiry, single-use, min purchase, max discount cap
- Coupon list UI: filters (active/draft/disabled/expired), search, delete with confirmation
- Campaign system: CRUD, audience filters, message composer (SMS/email), coupon attachment, scheduling
- Campaign list UI: status badges, delete with confirmation
- Campaign deep-link: "Book Now" links with customer auto-fill
- Mailgun webhook endpoint for email delivery tracking
- Customer type/tags system (enthusiast, detailer) with POS badges
- POS Promotions tab for applying coupons
- Consent validation warnings on campaigns
- Settings grouped into sections
- CONVENTIONS.md shared foundation doc created and referenced from all module docs
- **Dynamic Receipt Config:** Receipts pull branding from DB settings instead of hardcoded constants. Business Profile has website/email fields. Receipt Printer settings page with header overrides, logo upload (Supabase Storage `receipt-assets` bucket), logo width/position/alignment, custom text with placement options. All receipt API routes (print/email/sms) and client-side generators use `fetchReceiptConfig()` merge helper. Cashier first name shown on receipts. Preview button on settings page. Receipt buttons unified across admin and POS (Print, Email, SMS, Receipt) with consistent styling.
- **Customer Detail Page:** Combined Customer Type + Customer Journey card with vertical divider. Journey shows Since/Visits/Lifetime/Last Visit as pill-shaped stats. Receipt popup with 4 unified action buttons.

## Phase 5 — What's Remaining
- Lifecycle automation rules (service-based triggers, configurable timing, vehicle-aware reminders)
- Two-way SMS (inbound routed to Telegram, reply via Telegram)
- Google review request automation (post-service with direct link)
- Campaign analytics (delivery, opens, redemptions, revenue attribution, ROI)
- A/B testing for campaigns
- Full TCPA compliance audit (consent capture, opt-out handling complete audit log)

## Known Gaps (from Phase 1)
- Product and service edit pages partially implemented — list views exist but individual edit forms need completion
- Some settings sections are placeholder/incomplete (integrations, notifications)
- Business Profile now has website/email fields; Receipt Printer settings page is complete

## Key Architecture Notes
- Supabase project: `zwvahzymzardmxixyfim`
- Super-Admin: nayeem@smartdetailautospa.com
- Staff: Segundo Cadena (detailer), Joselyn Reyes (cashier), Joana Lira (cashier), Su Khan (admin)
- Email: Mailgun | SMS: Twilio | Payments: Stripe | Workflows: N8N
- All admin pages use `'use client'` behind auth; public pages use Server Components for SEO
- **POS Auth:** HMAC-SHA256 token in `sessionStorage` (`pos_session` key), validated via `X-POS-Session` header. Token utilities in `src/lib/pos/session.ts`, API helper in `src/lib/pos/api-auth.ts`, React context in `src/app/pos/context/pos-auth-context.tsx`, fetch wrapper in `src/app/pos/lib/pos-fetch.ts`
- **POS API routes** use `authenticatePosRequest()` + `createAdminClient()` (service role). Admin routes still use cookie-based `createClient()` + `supabase.auth.getUser()`
- **POS components** use `usePosAuth()` from `pos-auth-context` and `posFetch()` for all API calls. Admin components use `useAuth()` from `auth-provider` unchanged

## Session Instructions
- Update this file at end of session or when asked
- Reference `docs/PROJECT.md` for full specs, `docs/DASHBOARD_RULES.md` for admin UI structure
- Follow patterns in `docs/CONVENTIONS.md` for component APIs and auth
- POS files: use `usePosAuth()` (not `useAuth`), `posFetch()` (not `fetch`), `authenticatePosRequest()` in API routes
